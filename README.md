# Taxi-Trip-Duration
# Context of the project
Descriptive part: We seek to study the characteristics of the journeys of New York taxis. For this, we will calculate 4 indicators:

the average speed of each trip (in km / h) the number of trips made according to the day of the week the number of trips made according to the schedule of the day in increments of 4 hours. the number of km traveled per day of the week In addition, each indicator will be illustrated by a graph.

#Predictive part: 
You will set up a linear regression model which makes it possible to estimate the travel time as a function of its distance.

#Additional exercise

  - You will set up multilinear models.
  - For this you will justify that the variables you will use respect the conditions of the multilinear models.
  - You evaluate your different models
  - You will check that for the selected model:
    - that all the explanatory variables are significant
    - that the overall model is also significant.
In addition to this, you need to know more about it.
